# Matomo Simple A/B Testing Plugin

## Description

Free A/B Testing plugin for Matomo.

I created this as an alternative to Google Optimize, which was a free A/B testing tool.

Unfortunately, barely any tools are free, let alone affordable.

Want to start with A/B testing? You previously needed a big corporate contract for A/B testing software, making this out of reach for many small entrepreneurs and site owners.

That is why I built Matomo Simple A/B Testing.

1. Insert the custom A/B testing JS script once per domain.
2. Give a name for the experiment.
3. Insert custom CSS for the variant.
4. And/or insert custom JS for the variant.
5. Specify a regex for the page URLs where the experiment should be running.

Want more functionality? Of course, test the paid version of Matomo themselves.
